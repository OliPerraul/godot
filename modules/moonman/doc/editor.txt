NOTE:
	The idea is to eventually have both the in-game editor and the godot editor  inherit from  abstract editor components.


			--ABSTRACT_EDIT--
		 /					\
		/					 \
	--INGAME_EDIT--		--GODOT_EDIT--

	The main reason for this is to reduce code duplication and benefits from the update on main branch.

	

NOTE
	MoMaTypes should not be exposed to the user. Godot lack of support for namespace necesitate such convention.

	

NOTE 
	
	p_variable
	r_variable

		signify input parameter, output parameter respectively


NOTE

	Incorporate/implement strictly what is necessary through c++ modules

	Favor GDNative + GDScript whenever possible
